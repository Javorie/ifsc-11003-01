        <h2>About the Mars Rover Program</h2>
        <p>
            NASA’s Mars Rover Program uses advanced robotic vehicles to investigate Mars’ geology, climate, 
            atmosphere, and potential for ancient life. Rovers such as Curiosity and Perseverance examine Martian 
            rocks, soil, and environmental conditions to uncover the planet’s past and support future human missions.

        <!-- CURIOSITY -->
        <article class="rover-card">
            <h3>Curiosity</h3>

                 alt="Curiosity rover selfie taken in Gale Crater">

            <h4>Mission Goals & Overview</h4>
            <p>
                Curiosity investigates whether Mars ever had conditions suitable for microbial life. 
                Its research focuses on water activity, geology, climate, and environmental history.
            </p>

            <h4>Launch & Landing</h4>
            <p>
                Curiosity launched on November 26, 2011, and landed in Gale Crater on August 6, 2012 
                using the innovative Sky Crane landing system.
            </p>

            <h4>Major Discoveries</h4>
            <p>
                The rover discovered ancient lakebeds, organic molecules, and methane fluctuations—key evidence 
                that Mars once offered habitable conditions.
            </p>

            <h4>Key Technical Features</h4>
            <p>
                Curiosity includes a drill, robotic arm, Mastcam, ChemCam laser, radiation detector, and onboard 
                laboratory instruments for analyzing Martian samples.
            </p>

            <p>
                This terrain reveals how water shaped Gale Crater. The layered rocks help scientists reconstruct 
                Mars’ environmental history.

        <!-- PERSEVERANCE -->
        <article class="rover-card">
            <h3>Perseverance</h3>

            <img src="assets/img/perseverance-portrait.png" 
                 alt="Perseverance rover being prepared inside a NASA clean room">

            <h4>Mission Goals & Overview</h4>
            <p>
                Perseverance searches for signs of ancient microbial life, collects rock samples for potential 
                return to Earth, and tests new technology for future human exploration.
            </p>

            <h4>Launch & Landing</h4>
            <p>
                Launched July 30, 2020, Perseverance touched down in Jezero Crater on February 18, 2021—an area 
                rich in geological clues about ancient water.
            </p>

            <h4>Major Discoveries</h4>
            <p>
                The rover has documented sedimentary structures, minerals, and features that point to past 
                habitability and long-standing water systems.
            </p>

            <h4>Key Technical Features</h4>
            <p>
                Perseverance is equipped with spectrometers, ground-penetrating radar, upgraded wheels, a sample 
                caching system, and microphones that captured the first sounds from another planet.

            <h4>Ingenuity Helicopter</h4>
            <img src="assets/img/ingenuity.png" alt="NASA’s Ingenuity drone helicopter">

            <p>
                Ingenuity achieved the first powered flight on another planet, proving that aerial scouting is 
                possible on Mars.
