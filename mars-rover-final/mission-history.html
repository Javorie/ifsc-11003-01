        <h2>Overview of Rover Missions</h2>
        <p>
            NASA’s Mars rovers carry out long-term scientific investigations to better understand the 
            Red Planet’s geology, climate, and potential for ancient life. This page highlights major 
            mission milestones for Curiosity and Perseverance—two of NASA’s most advanced robotic explorers.

            <h3>Launch</h3>
            <p><strong>Date:</strong> November 26, 2011</p>
            <p>
                Curiosity launched aboard an Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral, beginning its eight-month 
                journey to Mars.

            <h3>Landing</h3>
            <p><strong>Date:</strong> August 6, 2012</p>
            <p>
                The rover successfully touched down in Gale Crater using the revolutionary Sky Crane landing 
                system—one of NASA’s most complex landing procedures ever attempted.

            <h3>Early Discoveries</h3>
            <p>
                Curiosity found evidence of ancient lakes, minerals formed in water, and organic molecules—strong 
                indicators that Mars once had conditions suitable for microbial life.
