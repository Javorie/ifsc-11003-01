        <!-- Question 1 -->
        <article class="faq-card">
            <h3 class="faq-question" tabindex="0">How many rovers has NASA sent to Mars?</h3>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>
                    NASA has successfully sent five rovers to Mars: <strong>Sojourner</strong> (1997), 
                    <strong>Spirit</strong> and <strong>Opportunity</strong> (2004), 
                    <strong>Curiosity</strong> (2012), and <strong>Perseverance</strong> (2021). 
                    Each rover has contributed important discoveries about Mars’ geology and history.

        <!-- Question 2 -->
        <article class="faq-card">
            <h3 class="faq-question" tabindex="0">What is the main mission of the Curiosity rover?</h3>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>
                    Curiosity’s mission is to investigate whether Mars ever had the right environmental 
                    conditions to support microbial life. It studies rock layers, soil chemistry, radiation, 
                    and the planet’s atmosphere inside Gale Crater.

        <!-- Question 3 -->
        <article class="faq-card">
            <h3 class="faq-question" tabindex="0">Why did Perseverance land in Jezero Crater?</h3>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>
                    Jezero Crater once held a lake and a river delta—areas where signs of past microbial life 
                    are most likely to be preserved. Perseverance explores these sediments and collects samples 
                    for a future return-to-Earth mission.

        <!-- Question 4 -->
        <article class="faq-card">
            <h3 class="faq-question" tabindex="0">What is the Ingenuity helicopter?</h3>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>
                    Ingenuity is a small experimental helicopter carried by Perseverance. It completed the 
                    first powered flights ever performed on another planet, proving that aerial exploration 
                    is possible in Mars’ thin atmosphere.

        <!-- Question 5 -->
        <article class="faq-card">
            <h3 class="faq-question" tabindex="0">How do rovers send images and data back to Earth?</h3>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>
                    Rovers transmit data to orbiters like Mars Odyssey and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. 
                    These orbiters then relay the information across millions of miles to NASA’s Deep Space 
                    Network on Earth.

        <!-- Question 6 -->
        <article class="faq-card">
            <h3 class="faq-question" tabindex="0">Where can I find real rover photos?</h3>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>
                    You can explore thousands of high-resolution rover images in NASA’s public archive: 
                    <a href="https://images.nasa.gov" target="_blank">images.nasa.gov</a>. 
                    The site includes photos from Curiosity, Perseverance, Spirit, Opportunity, and more.
