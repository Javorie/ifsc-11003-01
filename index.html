    <h2>Mars Rover Project Revision and Reflection</h2>

    <p>
      For the final revision of my Mars Rover project, I asked a friend to review my first draft and
      give honest feedback based on how a regular user might experience the site. The main issues they
      pointed out were that some sections felt text-heavy, the navigation could be clearer, and the FAQ
      page felt a little flat because nothing changed when you interacted with it. Hearing this from
      someone outside the class helped me see the project from a user’s point of view instead of only
      from a “does the code work?” perspective.
    </p>

    <p>
      Using that feedback, I revised the project by tightening up some of the wording, improving
      spacing and contrast for readability, and adding a simple JavaScript enhancement to the FAQ page
      so that answers appear when you click a question. This makes the page feel more interactive while
      still keeping the structure and design from my first draft. I also double-checked my image alt
      text and content hierarchy to make sure screen readers and keyboard users can move through the
      site more easily. The revised version of the project lives in my
      <strong>mars-rover-final</strong> directory.
    </p>

    <p>
      If I were starting over, I would plan my layout and content flow earlier in the process instead
      of figuring it out as I went. I’d also build with accessibility in mind from the beginning, since
      it is easier to keep headings, contrast, and alt text correct than to fix them afterward. One
      thing I think I did well was maintaining a consistent visual style across all three pages, using
      the same color palette, rounded cards, and typography. That consistency helps the project feel
      like a complete mini-site instead of three separate pages.
    </p>

    <p>
      Throughout the semester I learned how HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript work together to create
      a full experience: structure, design, and behavior. I became more comfortable validating my code,
      organizing files, and thinking about how real people use a site. Overall, this project pulled
      together many of the skills we practiced in class and showed me how much progress I made since
      the beginning of the course.

    <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>

    <p>
      Progressive enhancement is a web development approach that starts with a strong,
      functional foundation made with clean HTML so every user — regardless of device,
      browser, or internet speed — can access the core content. Once the basics are
      guaranteed to work, developers add CSS for layout and design, and JavaScript for
      richer interactions and advanced features. This ensures the site never breaks for
      users with limited support or accessibility tools.
    </p>

    <p>
      This method is important because the web is unpredictable. People use different
      devices, assistive technologies, and browsers, and sometimes CSS or JavaScript
      fail to load. Progressive enhancement creates more resilient, accessible, and
      user-friendly websites by making sure the essential content always works first.
    </p>

    <p>
      I read the article
      <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/understandingprogressiveenhancement/" target="_blank">
        “Understanding Progressive Enhancement” from A List Apart
      </a>,
      which explains how starting from a reliable baseline leads to stronger sites.
      I also found another helpful resource from MDN Web Docs:
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement" target="_blank">
        MDN: Progressive Enhancement Glossary
