        <h2>About the Mars Rover Program</h2>
        <p>
            NASA’s Mars Rover Program is a long-term exploration effort using advanced robotic vehicles 
            to study the planet's geology, atmosphere, climate, and potential for ancient life. 
            Rovers like Curiosity and Perseverance analyze Martian rocks, soil, and environmental conditions 
            to understand the planet’s history and prepare for future human exploration.

                 alt="Curiosity rover selfie on Mars showing its robotic arm, wheels, and the landscape of Gale Crater">

            <h4>Mission Goals & Overview</h4>
            <p>Curiosity was designed to determine whether Mars ever had the environmental conditions necessary to support microbial life. Its mission centers on studying the planet’s geology, climate, and the role of water on Mars.</p>

            <h4>Launch & Landing</h4>
            <p>Curiosity launched on November 26, 2011, aboard an Atlas V rocket and landed on August 6, 2012, in Gale Crater using NASA’s innovative Sky Crane system.</p>

            <h4>Major Discoveries</h4>
            <p>Curiosity discovered ancient lakebeds, organic molecules, and fluctuating methane—clues indicating Mars once had habitable conditions.</p>

            <h4>Key Technical & Design Features</h4>
            <p>Curiosity carries a robotic arm, drill, Mastcam, ChemCam laser, radiation detector, and onboard laboratory instruments for soil and rock analysis.</p>

             PERSEVERANCE ROVER CARD
        ============================= -->
        <article class="rover-card">
            <h3>Perseverance</h3>

            <img src="assets/img/perseverance-portrait.png" 
                 alt="Perseverance rover in a NASA clean room showing wheels and instruments">

            <h4>Mission Goals & Overview</h4>
            <p>Perseverance searches for signs of ancient microbial life, collects samples for future return to Earth, and tests technologies for human missions.</p>

            <h4>Launch & Landing</h4>
            <p>Launched July 30, 2020, Perseverance landed on February 18, 2021, in Jezero Crater—an ancient lakebed with strong potential for past life.</p>

            <h4>Major Discoveries</h4>
            <p>Perseverance identified ancient sedimentary rocks and minerals indicating a once-habitable environment. It began the first Martian sample cache.</p>

            <h4>Key Technical & Design Features</h4>
            <p>Perseverance includes SHERLOC and PIXL spectrometers, radar, upgraded wheels, a sample caching system, and microphones that recorded audio on Mars.</p>

                 alt="Soil and rock textures inside Jezero Crater captured by Perseverance">

            <p>This environmental image shows layered rocks and sediment deposits that give scientists clues about Mars’ ancient water systems in Jezero Crater.</p>

            <h4>Ingenuity Helicopter</h4>
            <img src="assets/img/ingenuity.png" 
                 alt="NASA Ingenuity helicopter with carbon-fiber blades during testing">

            <p>Ingenuity is a small experimental helicopter that achieved the first powered flight on another planet, proving that aerial exploration is possible on Mars.</p>
